## 2. Your Core Narrative: "The Bridge Builder"

Your biggest challenge is the career pivot from B2B Energy to B2C E-commerce. Your narrative must proactively bridge this gap. Every answer should subtly reinforce this theme:

**"I am a data product leader who builds bridges between complex data systems and clear business value. My background in optimizing physical systems with AI gives me a unique, first-principles approach to solving digital user problems in e-commerce."**

### **Talking Points to Weave In:**

*   **Problem-First Mindset:** "Whether it's optimizing an HVAC system or a user conversion funnel, the process is the same: define the problem, analyze the data, build a solution, and measure the impact."
*   **Data as the Universal Language:** "My deep technical background in Python and SQL allows me to have high-bandwidth conversations with engineering and data science, which is critical for building effective data products."
*   **From B2B to B2C:** "My B2B experience taught me how to manage complex stakeholder needs and deliver mission-critical reliability. I'm excited to apply that same rigor to the fast-paced, high-scale B2C environment at Lazada, focusing on the end-user."
*   **Proactive Learner:** Reference your personal e-commerce project and your CSPO certification to show you are proactively closing the domain knowledge gap.

## 3. Interview Questions & The Two-Minute STAR Answer

Here are the high-probability questions you will face. Use the **STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** framework to structure your answers into compelling two-minute stories.

### **Category 1: Behavioral & Leadership Questions**
*(Assessing your experience, collaboration style, and leadership)*

---

#### **Question 1: Tell me about yourself.**

**Goal:** A 90-second pitch connecting your past to this specific future role.

**Talking Points:**
*   Start with your current status (Data Product Consultant).
*   Summarize your 6+ years of experience, focusing on the *skill* (building AI/ML products) not the *domain* (energy).
*   Highlight a key achievement that shows impact (e.g., "managed the lifecycle of products that saved clients up to 45%").
*   Explicitly state why you are pivoting to e-commerce and why Lazada ("I'm passionate about applying my data optimization skills to the complex, high-scale user problems in e-commerce, and Lazada is the market leader...").
*   Mention your proactive steps (personal project, certification).

---

#### **Question 2: Tell me about a time you had to manage a complex product from start to finish.**

**Goal:** Prove you understand and have executed the full product lifecycle.

*   **SITUATION:** "At Azendian Solutions, our B2B clients in the hospitality sector had massive hot water systems but no way to track or optimize their energy consumption, leading to huge operational waste and sustainability issues. The data was there, but it was siloed and unusable."
*   **TASK:** "My task was to manage the entire lifecycle of a new AI-powered data product that would provide real-time optimization recommendations. I was responsible for everything from market analysis and requirements gathering to defining success metrics and overseeing the go-to-market plan for the Australian market."
*   **ACTION:** "First, I led consultations with key clients to deeply understand their needs and define the core user problems. I translated these into a prioritized backlog and clear user stories for the engineering team. I worked with designers to create an intuitive dashboard and collaborated closely with data scientists to validate the AI model. I defined our primary success metric as 'percentage of energy reduction' and our key engagement metric as 'daily active users' on the dashboard."
*   **RESULT:** "The product we launched was a major success. We successfully deployed it in several pilot projects, and clients saw **up to a 45% reduction in their energy costs**. This project validated the market need and became a cornerstone of our sustainability product suite. This experience solidified my framework for taking a complex data problem and delivering a user-centric product with measurable impact."

---

#### **Question 3: Describe a time you had a major disagreement with an engineer or a stakeholder. How did you handle it?**

**Goal:** Show you are a collaborative partner who can navigate conflict constructively.

*   **SITUATION:** "While at Teale, we were developing an ML-based predictive maintenance feature for HVAC systems. The engineering lead was adamant about using a complex, deep-learning model because it was technically more sophisticated and could yield a marginally higher accuracy in our labs."
*   **TASK:** "My task was to advocate for the user and the business goals. I was concerned that the more complex model would require significantly more server resources, increase latency, and be harder to interpret and maintain, potentially delaying our launch and increasing operational costs."
*   **ACTION:** "Instead of arguing about which model was 'better,' I reframed the discussion around the customer and business impact. I brought data to the table. I presented a cost-benefit analysis showing the projected cloud hosting costs for both models. I also shared user feedback that stressed the need for speed and reliability over a 1-2% accuracy gain. I proposed we launch with a simpler, more robust model (a gradient-boosted tree) and set a clear performance benchmark. If that benchmark wasn't met, we would have the business case to invest in the more complex model for V2."
*   **RESULT:** "The engineering lead agreed. By focusing on shared goals—delivering user value quickly and managing costs—we found common ground. We launched on time with the simpler model, which **improved fault detection by 30%** and met all our performance targets. The team appreciated that the decision was data-driven, not based on opinion, which strengthened our working relationship."

### **Category 2: Product Sense & Strategy Questions**
*(Assessing your ability to think like a user-focused business owner)*

---

#### **Question 4: Lazada wants to improve the user retention rate. What would you do?**

**Goal:** Demonstrate a structured, data-driven approach to a broad problem.

**Talking Points (Use a framework):**
1.  **Clarify & Define:** "That's a great, impactful goal. Before I dive into solutions, I need to understand more.
    *   'User retention' can mean many things. Are we focused on retaining new users after their first purchase (D7, D30 retention)? Or retaining our loyal, high-value customers?
    *   What's the current retention rate, and what's the business's target?
    *   Do we have any existing data or hypotheses about why users are churning? Is it price, selection, app performance, or something else?"

2.  **Analyze the User & Problem (External/Internal):** "Assuming we're focused on early-user churn, I'd first break down the user journey into key phases: **Activation** (first purchase), **Engagement** (browsing, adding to cart), and **Re-Engagement** (notifications, emails).
    *   **Data Analysis:** I'd work with data analysts to dive into our analytics (like Amplitude or Google Analytics). My first query would be to build a cohort analysis to see *when* users drop off. Is it after 3 days? 7 days? 30 days?
    *   **Qualitative Analysis:** Data tells you *what* is happening, not *why*. I would partner with UX research to conduct surveys and interviews with churned users to understand their pain points."

3.  **Ideate Solutions (Brainstorm):** "Based on the analysis, let's hypothesize the problem is a poor post-purchase experience. Some ideas could be:
    *   **Product:** A personalized 'For You' section based on their first purchase to drive a second purchase.
    *   **Notifications:** A smart, non-spammy notification system that alerts them to a price drop on a viewed item.
    *   **Gamification:** A 'Lazada Rewards' program that gives points for repeat purchases."

4.  **Prioritize & Propose:** "We can't build everything. I'd use a simple **Impact vs. Effort** framework. The personalized 'For You' section seems high-impact and might leverage existing recommendation models, making it a potentially moderate-effort feature. I would propose we start there."

5.  **Measure Success:** "We'd launch this as an A/B test. The primary metric would be **D30 retention rate** for new users. Secondary metrics would include **conversion rate** on the new module and **time to second purchase**. This data would inform our next iteration."

---

#### **Question 5: Let's say you are the PM for the Lazada search results page. How would you measure its success?**

**Goal:** Show you can define meaningful metrics that align with business goals.

**Talking Points:**
"The success of a search page is ultimately about getting the user to what they want, as quickly as possible, and in a way that drives revenue. I'd break the metrics down into a hierarchy:"

*   **North Star Metric:**
    *   **Search Conversion Rate:** (Number of purchases that started with a search) / (Total number of searches). This is the ultimate measure of search quality and business impact.

*   **Tier 1: User Success Metrics:**
    *   **Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Search Results:** Are users finding relevant items on the first page?
    *   **Time to First Click:** How quickly do they find something interesting?
    *   **Search Abandonment Rate:** What percentage of searches result in zero clicks? This is a key failure metric.
    *   **"Add to Cart" from Search:** A stronger signal of intent than a simple click.

*   **Tier 2: System Performance Metrics (Guardrail Metrics):**
    *   **Search Latency:** How fast are the results returned? Sub-second is critical. Slow search will kill conversion.
    *   **Zero-Result Rate:** How often does a search yield no results? This points to issues with our catalog or search algorithm's ability to handle typos and synonyms.

*   **Qualitative Feedback:**
    *   "I would also implement a simple 'Were these results helpful?' (Yes/No) feedback mechanism on the page to gather direct user sentiment, which can help diagnose problems that quantitative metrics might miss."

"By monitoring this balanced scorecard of metrics, we can understand not just *if* search is working, but *how* and *why* it is or isn't, allowing us to make targeted improvements."

### **Category 3: Data & Technical Acumen Questions**
*(Assessing your ability to work with data and engineers)*

---

#### **Question 6: Walk me through your process for using data to make a product decision.**

**Goal:** Connect your resume experience to a repeatable, data-driven process.

*   **SITUATION:** "In my role as an Independent Consultant, a B2B client wanted to reduce energy costs across their portfolio of buildings but didn't know where to start. They believed the problem was simply inefficient equipment."
*   **TASK:** "My task was to use their data to validate the core problem and propose a data product solution. I needed to move them from assumption to a data-backed strategy."
*   **ACTION:**
    *   **Hypothesis Formulation:** My initial hypothesis was that the problem wasn't just the equipment, but *how* it was being operated.
    *   **Data Discovery & Collection:** I first identified all available data sources—legacy Building Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, and even manual operator logs. The data was messy and in different formats.
    *   **Data Analysis (The Core Work):** I built a Python script to ingest and clean the data. Using Pandas, I analyzed time-series data of energy consumption against building occupancy. I used SQL to query historical alarm data. I created a Tableau dashboard to visualize the patterns.
    *   **Insight Generation:** The analysis revealed that the biggest energy spikes occurred during periods of low occupancy. The equipment was fine; the automated schedules were wrong. This completely shifted the focus of the problem.
*   **RESULT:** "I presented this dashboard to the client. Seeing the clear correlation between time and waste, they immediately understood the real issue. This data-driven analysis became the business case for a **new automated reporting product**, which my framework enabled. The project shifted from a costly hardware upgrade to a high-ROI software solution, **saving them an estimated 80% in manual analysis time** and paving the way for significant energy savings."

#### **Question 7: Imagine our data science team has built a new recommendation model that is 5% more accurate in offline testing. What is your process for deciding whether to launch it?**

**Goal:** Show you understand the difference between offline and online performance and can manage risk.

**Talking Points:**
"That's a fantastic starting point, but offline accuracy is only part of the story. A 5% gain in a lab doesn't automatically mean a better user experience or more revenue. Here's my process:"

1.  **Ask "Accuracy at What Cost?":**
    *   "First, I'd meet with the data science and engineering teams. Is this new model more computationally expensive? Will it increase page load times (latency)? A 5% better recommendation isn't worth it if it adds 500ms to the user's wait time."

2.  **Define the Online A/B Test:**
    *   "The only way to know the true impact is with a live A/B test. We would deploy the new model to a small percentage of users (e.g., 5%)."
    *   **Hypothesis:** 'The new recommendation model will lead to a higher add-to-cart rate from the recommendation module.'

3.  **Establish Key Metrics:**
    *   **Primary Metric (User Value):** Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Add-to-Cart Rate from the recommendation module.
    *   **Secondary Metric (Business Value):** Overall Revenue Per User and Average Order Value. Does it lead to more valuable purchases?
    *   **Guardrail Metrics (Don't Harm):** Page Load Time, Unfollow/Hide Rate on recommendations, and overall site conversion rate. We must ensure we're not improving one area while hurting another.

4.  **Analyze and Decide:**
    *   "After running the test long enough to achieve statistical significance, we'll analyze the results.
    *   **Scenario A (Win-Win):** If CTR and Revenue are up, and guardrail metrics are stable, it's an easy decision: launch.
    *   **Scenario B (Mixed Results):** If CTR is up but Revenue is flat, or if Page Load Time increases slightly, it's a product decision. We need to weigh the pros and cons. Maybe the model is recommending cheaper items? This requires a deeper dive.
    *   **Scenario C (Offline vs. Online Mismatch):** If the online metrics are worse, we've learned something valuable. We'd work with the data science team to understand why the offline accuracy didn't translate and iterate."

"In short, I treat a new model like any new feature: validate its real-world impact through rigorous online testing before a full rollout."
