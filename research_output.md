As a Senior Tech Career Consultant, I have conducted a thorough analysis of the candidate's resume and the specified job profile. Please note that my tools do not permit accessing external URLs. Therefore, for the purpose of this analysis, I have proceeded based on a standard, industry-aligned **Data Scientist** role at Garena, a leading gaming and e-commerce company. My evaluation is based on this well-established industry profile.

Here is a detailed breakdown and comparison:

### 1. Assumed Job Requirements: Data Scientist at Garena

Based on industry standards for a company like Garena, a Data Scientist role would typically focus on user data to drive business decisions.

*   **Primary Objective:** Analyze massive datasets related to user behavior, game mechanics, and monetization to provide actionable insights. Develop and deploy machine learning models to enhance user experience, predict churn, detect fraud, and optimize marketing efforts.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Perform exploratory data analysis on player and transaction data.
    *   Design and analyze A/B tests for new features and promotions.
    *   Build predictive models (e.g., churn prediction, Lifetime Value).
    *   Develop recommendation engines for in-game content or e-commerce products.
    *   Collaborate with product, engineering, and marketing teams.
*   **Required Qualifications & Experience:**
    *   **Education:** Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related quantitative field.
    *   **Experience:** 2-5 years of hands-on experience in a data science or analytics role. Direct experience in the gaming, e-commerce, or mobile app industry is highly preferred.
*   **Required Skills:**
    *   **Programming:** Expert-level Python (with a focus on libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and SQL.
    *   **Machine Learning:** Strong foundation in statistical modeling, classification, regression, clustering, and experimental design (A/B testing).
    *   **Big Data Tech:** Experience with distributed computing frameworks like Spark, Hive, or cloud-based equivalents (Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift).
    *   **Visualization & BI:** Proficiency with tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker to communicate findings.

### 2. Candidate-Job Fit Analysis: Strengths and Gaps

Here is a comparison of Made Putra's resume against the assumed Data Scientist role.

#### âœ… **Strengths (Strong Match)**

*   **Data Analytics & ML Core:** The candidate has 6+ years of experience in data analytics and applying ML models (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) for predictive maintenance and optimization. This foundational skill is highly transferable.
*   **Python & SQL Proficiency:** He lists Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and SQL as core skills, which are essential for the Data Scientist role.
*   **End-to-End Project Delivery:** His experience in delivering "AI-driven energy optimization projects" and designing "data pipelines and interactive dashboards" shows he can manage a project from data ingestion to insight delivery.
*   **Cloud & Tools:** Experience with AWS, Azure, Docker, and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau are directly relevant and meet the job requirements.

#### ðŸŸ¡ **Weaknesses (Potential Gaps)**

*   **Domain Mismatch:** The candidate's entire career is specialized in **Energy Management, Sustainability, and HVAC systems**. This is a vastly different domain from Garena's focus on **Gaming and E-commerce**. The nature of the data (sensor/IoT data vs. user/transaction data) and the business problems (energy efficiency vs. user engagement) are fundamentally different.
*   **Specific ML Applications:** The resume highlights predictive maintenance and energy optimization. There is no mention of experience with core gaming/e-commerce ML applications like **recommendation systems, churn prediction, user segmentation, or fraud detection**.
*   **Big Data Technologies:** While the candidate has experience with data pipelines, the resume does not explicitly mention experience with large-scale distributed computing technologies like **Spark or Hive**, which are standard for handling massive user data at companies like Garena. His experience seems more focused on IoT data integration protocols (MQTT, Modbus).
*   **Statistical Rigor (A/B Testing):** The role of a Data Scientist in gaming and e-commerce heavily relies on rigorous A/B testing and experimental design. This is not mentioned in the candidate's resume.

### 3. Missing Skills & Recommended Certifications

To pivot successfully into a Data Scientist role at Garena, the candidate needs to bridge the domain gap and acquire specific technical skills.

#### **Missing Skills:**

1.  **Domain-Specific ML Models:**
    *   Churn Prediction Modeling
    *   Recommendation Systems (Collaborative & Content-Based Filtering)
    *   Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction
    *   User Segmentation & Clustering
    *   A/B Testing and Causal Inference
2.  **Big Data Frameworks:**
    *   **Apache Spark:** This is the most critical missing technical skill. It is the industry standard for processing the volume of data Garena generates.
    *   Experience with cloud-native data warehouses like Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift.
3.  **Business Acumen:**
    *   Demonstrable understanding of gaming/e-commerce KPIs (DAU, MAU, ARPU, Conversion Rate, Retention).

#### **Recommended Certifications & Actions:**

1.  **Bridge the Big Data Gap:**
    *   **Certification:** **Databricks Certified Data Scientist Associate** or **Cloudera Certified Data Scientist**. These certifications specifically validate skills in using Spark for data science workflows.
    *   **Action:** Complete online courses and build portfolio projects using PySpark on large, public datasets (e.g., e-commerce transaction data, game logs).
2.  **Develop Domain-Specific ML Skills:**
    *   **Certification:** While less common, specialized certifications like the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate** can demonstrate broader skills.
    *   **Action:** The best approach is building **portfolio projects** that directly address Garena's business. For example:
        *   Build a movie or product recommendation engine using the MovieLens or an Amazon dataset.
        *   Analyze a public dataset to predict customer churn.
        *   Conduct a mock analysis of an A/B test.
        *   Publish these projects on GitHub and write a blog post explaining the methodology and results.
3.  **Demonstrate Business Acumen:**
    *   **Action:** Follow industry leaders, read Garena's investor reports, and analyze their games from a data perspective. In cover letters and interviews, the candidate must be able to "talk the talk" of the gaming/e-commerce industry.

### 4. Industrial Standard for Tools

*   **Is the posted role using the most common industrial tools?**
    *   Yes. The assumed role of a Data Scientist at Garena relies on the gold-standard toolkit for modern data science: **Python, SQL, Spark, and major cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)**. These are the most in-demand skills in the industry.

*   **How does the candidate's toolkit align?**
    *   The candidate's toolkit is **partially aligned**. He is strong in Python, SQL, and cloud platforms. However, the lack of demonstrated experience with a distributed computing framework like **Spark** is a significant gap for a role handling consumer-scale data. His expertise in IoT protocols (MQTT, Modbus, BACnet) and energy simulation software (ANSYS, EnergyPlus) is highly specialized and not relevant to this role.
