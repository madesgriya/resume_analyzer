Of course. As a Senior Tech Career Consultant, I have conducted a thorough analysis of the candidate's resume against the Senior/Principal Geothermal Reservoir Engineer position at SLB.

Here is a detailed breakdown of my findings, including missing skills, certification advice, and industry context, presented in a clear markdown format.

### **Career Consultation: Resume vs. SLB Geothermal Reservoir Engineer Role**

This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison between the candidate profile of Made Putra and the requirements for the Senior/Principal Geothermal Reservoir Engineer role at SLB.

---

### **1. High-Level Summary: Candidate-Role Fit**

This is a **low-fit role** for the candidate. While Mr. Putra is a strong professional in AI-driven energy management for buildings and industrial systems, the SLB position is in a different, highly specialized engineering discipline: **subsurface geothermal reservoir engineering**. The overlap in skills is minimal and confined to general data analysis and cloud computing, which are listed as secondary or preferred qualifications for the role.

The candidate's current career trajectory is that of an **Energy Data Scientist**, whereas the job is for a **Geothermal Reservoir Engineer**. These are fundamentally different career paths.

### **2. Detailed Skill Gap Analysis**

Here is a breakdown of the skills and experience required by the job, contrasted with the candidate's resume.

| Category | Job Requirement (SLB) | Candidate Profile (Made Putra) | Gap Analysis & Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Domain Experience** | 8-12 years in reservoir engineering, with significant experience in **geothermal projects**. | 6+ years in **AI-driven energy management** for HVAC, solar, and building systems. | **CRITICAL GAP.** The candidate's experience is in optimizing energy consumption *above ground*. The role requires expertise in managing heat and fluid flow in *subsurface rock formations*. This is the most significant mismatch. |
| **Reservoir Simulation** | Expertise in **TOUGH2/iTOUGH2, AUTOUGH, Petrasim**. | Experience with EnergyPlus, IESVE, ANSYS (CFD), SolidWorks. | **CRITICAL GAP.** The required software (TOUGH2 family) is the industry standard for modeling geothermal reservoirs. The candidate's software skills are for building energy modeling and mechanical design, which are not transferable. |
| **Well Test Analysis** | Proficiency in **Saphir, KAPPA**. | No mention of this software or specific well testing experience. | **CRITICAL GAP.** Well testing is a core competency for reservoir engineers to understand resource potential. The candidate's data analysis skills are general and not applied to this specific domain. |
| **Programming & Data** | **Python**, R, or MATLAB. | **STRONG MATCH.** Excellent skills in Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas). | This is the candidate's primary strength and aligns well with the industry's trend towards data-driven analysis. |
| **Cloud Computing** | Preferred: **Azure, AWS, GCP**. | **STRONG MATCH.** Experience with **Azure** and **AWS**. | The candidate meets the preferred qualifications here, which is a positive signal for roles that blend traditional engineering with modern tech. |
| **Scientific Knowledge** | Preferred: **Geochemistry** and **Geomechanical modeling**. | Background in Mechanical Engineering. No evidence of geochemistry or geomechanics knowledge. | **MAJOR GAP.** This highlights the role's focus on subsurface earth sciences, which is outside the candidate's academic and professional scope. |
| **Education** | Bachelor's in Petroleum, Chemical, or Mechanical Eng. **Master's/PhD highly preferred**. | Bachelor's in Marine and Mechanical Engineering. | **PARTIAL MATCH.** The Bachelor's degree is relevant, but the lack of a postgraduate degree is a disadvantage for a senior/principal-level scientific role where advanced degrees are common. |

### **3. Industry Standards & Tooling**

*   **Is the role using common industrial tools?**
    *   **Yes, absolutely.** The tools listed—**TOUGH2**, **AUTOUGH**, and **KAPPA (Saphir)**—are the definitive industry standards for geothermal reservoir simulation and well test analysis. SLB, as a market leader, is using the exact software expected for a role of this seniority.
*   **What are the industrial standards for this role?**
    *   **Deep Domain Specialization:** Senior roles in this field demand proven, hands-on experience with geothermal assets. General energy or data science experience is not a substitute.
    *   **Advanced Education:** A Master's or PhD is the norm for principal-level engineering roles, especially in research-intensive fields like reservoir modeling.
    *   **Cross-functional Collaboration:** The role requires working with geoscientists and drilling engineers, reinforcing the need for foundational knowledge in those adjacent fields.

---

### **4. Advice on Certifications**

The candidate's **Certified Energy Manager (CEM)** certification is highly valuable for his current career path in energy efficiency and building management. However, **it holds little to no weight for a Geothermal Reservoir Engineer position.**

*   **Recommendation:** Do not pursue further certifications to bridge this gap. There is no certification that can replace the required 8-12 years of hands-on reservoir engineering experience and specialized software expertise. The gap is one of fundamental experience, not credentials.

### **5. Strategic Career Advice for the Candidate**

Mr. Putra has two primary paths forward:

**Option A: Pivot to Geothermal Engineering (High Effort, Long-Term Plan)**

If the candidate is passionate about moving into geothermal reservoir engineering, a strategic pivot is necessary.

1.  **Formal Education:** The most direct route is to pursue a **Master's degree** in Petroleum Engineering or a related field with a specialization in reservoir modeling or geothermal energy.
2.  **Seek Transitional Roles:** Look for positions like "Data Scientist, New Energy" or "Data Engineer, Geothermal" within companies like SLB. This would leverage his existing strengths in Python and cloud computing while allowing him to learn the geothermal domain from within the industry.
3.  **Gain Foundational Experience:** He would need to start in a more junior role post-education to gain hands-on experience with the core software (TOUGH2, KAPPA) before being considered for a senior position.

**Option B: Double Down on Strengths (Recommended Path)**

The candidate's resume is exceptionally strong for roles that match his current expertise.

1.  **Target the Right Roles:** Focus job searches on titles like:
    *   `AI in Energy Consultant`
    *   `Energy Data Scientist`
    *   `Cleantech Data Analyst`
    *   `Sustainability Technology Manager`
2.  **Target the Right Companies:** Seek out companies in the smart buildings, renewable energy optimization (solar/wind), utility analytics, and ESG technology sectors. His experience with Azendian and Teale makes him a perfect fit for these.
3.  **Tailor the Resume:** For these roles, he should continue to highlight his achievements in cutting energy use by 45% through AI, developing ML-based predictive maintenance, and designing scalable data pipelines—these are powerful, relevant accomplishments for his field.
