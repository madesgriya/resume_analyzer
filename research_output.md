As a Senior Tech Career Consultant, I have analyzed the provided resume. However, a critical part of the request—analyzing the job posting from the provided URL—cannot be completed as my tools do not permit access to external websites.

To provide valuable guidance, I will proceed by making an informed assumption based on the URL and job ID (`GP300001005`). The "GP" prefix often corresponds to Group-level Product roles at Lazada. Therefore, I will base my analysis on a hypothetical **Senior Product Manager - Data** role at an e-commerce company like Lazada. This allows for a constructive comparison and detailed feedback for the candidate, Made Putra.

### **2. Candidate Profile vs. Job Requirements: A Gap Analysis**

#### **Candidate's Strengths**

Made Putra's resume demonstrates a powerful foundation that is highly attractive for any data-centric role:

*   **Exceptional Technical & Data Skills:** Strong proficiency in Python (with ML libraries), SQL, AWS, and Azure is a significant asset. This technical depth allows for high-bandwidth conversations with engineering teams.
*   **Proven Impact with Data:** The candidate has a stellar track record of using AI/ML and data analytics to deliver measurable business outcomes (e.g., "cutting energy use up to 45%", "improving fault detection by 30%"). This results-oriented approach is exactly what product managers need.
*   **Consulting Experience:** His background as a consultant implies strong stakeholder management, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are transferable to a product role.

#### **Critical Gaps & Missing Skills**

The candidate is making a significant career pivot from **B2B Industrial Energy Tech** to **B2C/Internal E-commerce Product Management**. The resume, in its current form, does not bridge this gap effectively.

1.  **Lack of Explicit Product Management Experience:**
    *   **The Problem:** The resume speaks the language of an engineer and a consultant, not a product manager. Key product management functions like **roadmap development, backlog prioritization, writing user stories, A/B testing, user research, and go-to-market strategy** are completely absent.
    *   **The Impact:** Recruiters and hiring managers will likely screen this resume out for not meeting the core requirement of "product management experience."

2.  **Lack of E-commerce Domain Knowledge:**
    *   **The Problem:** The candidate's entire 6+ year career is in the energy, sustainability, and industrial systems sector. There is no demonstrated knowledge of e-commerce concepts like **customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), conversion rate optimization (CRO), churn, or online user behavior**.
    *   **The Impact:** The hiring team will question his ability to understand the business context and user needs at Lazada, which are fundamentally different from his past roles.

### **3. Actionable Advice & Recommendations**

To be a competitive candidate, Made Putra must proactively address these gaps.

#### **A. Resume & Narrative Reframing**

The experience is valuable, but it needs to be translated. He must rewrite his resume to highlight product management competencies.

*   **From:** *“Delivered 5+ long-term AI-driven energy optimization projects...”*
*   **To:** *“Managed the full lifecycle of 5+ AI-powered data products for energy optimization, from initial stakeholder consultation and requirements gathering to defining success metrics and overseeing deployment, resulting in up to 45% operational savings.”*

*   **From:** *“Modeled energy workflows for 15+ clients, identifying IDR 70B in potential savings.”*
*   **To:** *“Conducted data-driven opportunity analysis for 15+ B2B clients to identify and validate product opportunities, successfully building the business case for initiatives with a potential impact of IDR 70B.”*

This reframing shifts the focus from "doing the engineering work" to "managing the product and its business outcome."

#### **B. Required Skills & Certifications to Acquire**

1.  **Formalize Product Management Knowledge:**
    *   **Certification (Highly Recommended):** Acquiring a certification is the fastest way to signal formal training and commitment to this career pivot.
        *   **Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO):** Industry-recognized and focuses on Agile methodologies.
        *   **Pragmatic Institute Certifications:** Well-regarded for a comprehensive view of product management.
    *   **Courses:** Enroll in reputable online courses on Product Management from platforms like Coursera, Reforge, or BrainStation to learn the core frameworks.

2.  **Build E-commerce Domain Knowledge:**
    *   **Personal Projects:** This is crucial. He should create a project using a public e-commerce dataset (e.g., from Kaggle). For example:
        *   Build a simple customer segmentation model.
        *   Analyze a user funnel to identify drop-off points.
        *   Create a basic recommendation engine.
        This project should be featured prominently on his resume.
    *   **Immerse in the Industry:** Follow e-commerce news, read blogs from industry leaders (e.g., Lenny's Newsletter), and study Lazada's investor reports and product offerings deeply.

3.  **Learn Industry-Standard Tools:**
    *   While his technical stack is strong, he is missing product-specific tools. He should get familiar with:
        *   **JIRA & Confluence:** The bread and butter for most tech product teams. Many free tutorials are available.
        *   **User Analytics Platforms (Amplitude/Mixpanel):** Understand how digital products are tracked. Many offer free plans to experiment with.

### **Final Verdict**

Made Putra possesses the raw analytical talent and technical intelligence to succeed in a data product role. However, he is currently a high-potential candidate with a high-risk profile due to the significant career pivot. His success in landing this role is **highly dependent** on his ability to:

1.  **Rewrite his narrative** to align with product management principles.
2.  **Proactively demonstrate** e-commerce domain knowledge through personal projects.
3.  **Signal commitment** through relevant certifications and upskilling in industry-standard tools.

Without these changes, it will be very difficult to compete against candidates with direct experience in digital product management.
